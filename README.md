# QR_CODE_GENERATOR
I made a QR code generator in python. This tool receives data entered by the user and converts it into a QR code which is easily shareable as well as scannable. The generator uses Python libraries to encode the input data into QR vertices, providing an often-convenient and limited display of this information.
